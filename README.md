# Who's That Pokemon?

Give it a test drive: https://clinquant-bonbon-b04b6e.netlify.app

A game built with NextJS that emulates the *Who's that Pokemon* TV game. The game shows the silhouette of a random Pokemon. To play, simply guess which of the four random options match the silhouette either with the number keys or by clicking the right button.

How high can you get your streak?

Gotta guess them all!
